"""`legio.flow.payload` — payload building (AGENT_LIFECYCLE §12.1).

Each agent receives the incoming ``payload``, reads only what it needs under its
``input_as`` (an alias it owns), performs its processing, and **builds its own
new payload** under its ``output_as``. The payload is **construction, not
accumulation**: ``build_payload`` produces exactly ``{output_as: output}`` — it
never merges or extends the incoming payload, and it never mutates state. The
re-keying (cambio de clave) to the next agent's ``input_as`` is the handoff
step's responsibility (AGENT_LIFECYCLE §12.1, Session 20), not this builder's.
