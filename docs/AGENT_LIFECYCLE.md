# Agent Lifecycle — dynamic loading and unloading of agents

Scope: how agent **classes** and agent **instances** are created, enabled,
disabled and destroyed, in a fully decoupled architecture.

This document is the authoritative design for the lifecycle of agents. It is
derived from the reference project `voice-notes-api` (used as the baseline) and
extends it with **dynamic** loading/unloading, which the reference does not
have. The vocabulary is deliberately fixed: **create / enable / disable /
destroy**, only — no other verbs such as "down"/"up"/"load"/"unload".

> Design note (AGENTS.md rule: decoupling is a hard rule). The manager never
> decides the DAG nor the routing. The agent that starts a leg concretizes and
> passes the DAG. The `AgentRegistry` governs only **existence and lifecycle**
> (create/enable/disable/destroy) as a *posterior mirror of facts* — never the
> DAG, never routing, and never the materialization itself (that is the
> `TaskManager`'s, orchestrated by the `Runtime`; see §0 and §6).

## 0. Decoupled roles: Runtime vs AgentRegistry vs TaskManager vs beaver vs lingo

`legio` keeps five independent layers that never know one another:

- **`Runtime`** — the only layer with initiative, and the **public face** of the
  lifecycle. It decides operations, exposes them (CLI / HTTP / programmatic),
  orchestrates the other two, and **records facts after they happen**. It never
  executes agent work itself. Its functions are detailed in §6.
- **`AgentRegistry`** — the **memory of the node's agent state at runtime**. It
  owns (a) the **live catalog** — the state of classes/instances/dependencies —
  and (b) the **runtime cache of YAML specs** (§4.7). It is a **mirror of facts**:
  every entry is written **after** (never before) the corresponding fact
  occurred, so the catalog never reports something that does not exist. It never
  materializes or executes anything.
- **`TaskManager`** — the **mini-castor task engine** (submit, status, task
  executors draining the task queues, scheduling by `next_run_at`). It is the
  **executor of facts**: the Runtime asks it for an *action* in task language,
  and it is what actually executes the fact — e.g. running the callable that is
  the internal loop of an agent the Runtime decided to create (§6.1). It is
  **blind to the domain and to the AgentRegistry** — it only knows
  "run this task / stop this task", never that a task is "the agent lifecycle".
  Implemented in `legio` itself (see `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`, "Excluded on
  purpose"); its functional reference is `castor-io`. The `TaskManager` scales
  the Runtime and the Registry.
- **`beaver`** — the single substrate (registries, priority queues, locks). All of
  the above sit on it.
- **`lingo`** — LLM + structured output (the role the reference's `argo` played
  for LLM interaction).

**The regulating principle — registration is a mirror of facts.** Nothing is
registered before it happens. The vocabulary is strict:

- **Action** — what the `Runtime` asks the `TaskManager` to do, in task
  language (imperative: run/stop/pause a task — bring up an agent's loop, stop
  it). Opening/closing the class entry is **not** an Action: the entry
  gate is the Runtime's own submission-side check (§5.6, §6.1).
- **Fact** — the reality that results in the world (an agent's own loop runs and
  polls its class's queue; a task runs; a task is paused/cancelled). It is
  **provoked/administered by the `TaskManager`**, but it is the *reality itself*,
  not the TaskManager's output.
- **Record** — what the `AgentRegistry` stores, **after** the fact occurred
  (posteriori mirror). Never before.
- **Operation** — what the `Runtime` exposes (create_class, enable_class, ...);
  it is exactly *action → fact → record*.

So the `Runtime` is the **translator** between two languages: it asks the
`TaskManager` for *actions* (in task language) and then tells the `AgentRegistry`
which *records* to store (in catalog language). The `TaskManager` never knows the
AgentRegistry; the `AgentRegistry` never knows the TaskManager; only the `Runtime`
knows both and translates.

There is no central scheduler: instances (agents) poll their own queue over
beaver autonomously, and task scheduling is a field (`next_run_at`) — never
callbacks or sleeps (AGENTS.md rule 8). Nothing here uses Redis or any broker.

---

## 1. Two levels

Every operation lives at one of two levels:

### 1.1 Class (the agent type / pattern)

- The **definition**: the pattern spec (`PatternSpec`, derived from YAML).
- Its **queue**, named after the type (e.g. `summ`).
- Its **kind binding**: the concrete agent type (`linguistic` / `tool` /
  `sequence` / `parallel`) derived from the spec.
- Its **dependencies** (from the spec): a composite references other classes by
  name (its `sequence` / `parallel`). Depended-on classes are the class's
  **dependencies**; classes that reference it are its **dependents**.
- Governed by the **AgentRegistry** (existence reflected in the live catalog);
  its instances are brought up by the **TaskManager** executing the fact at the
  **Runtime**'s direction (§0/§6).

### 1.2 Instance (a concrete agent of the class)

- A concrete agent that runs and **polls** the class's queue with its own
  internal loop (LEG-023).
- An instance exists *in the catalog* only because an **agent was actually
  brought up** (the Runtime decided it, the TaskManager executed the fact at the
  Runtime's request) and the fact was then recorded in the `AgentRegistry` (§0,
  registration-is-a-mirror). There is no "instance supervisor" — the `Runtime`
  is what decides and orchestrates.

---

## 2. The four verbs

Only these verbs, applied to both levels:

| Verb | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **create** | bring into existence something that did not exist |
| **enable** | make active / operational (re-open, resume) — reversible |
| **disable** | make inactive / suspended, without removing existence — reversible |
| **destroy** | remove entirely — irreversible |

---

## 3. Two axes of state

For both a class and an instance:

1. **Existence:** `does not exist` → `created` → (destroyed).
2. **Activity** (only meaningful if it exists): `enabled` / `disabled`.

Verbs map to the axes:

- **create:** `does not exist` → `created` (policy decides if born enabled or
  disabled).
- **destroy:** `created` → `does not exist` (irreversible).
- **enable:** `created & disabled` → `created & enabled`.
- **disable:** `created & enabled` → `created & disabled`.

---

## 4. Verb matrix (Class and Instance)

| Verb | **Class** (type) | **Instance** (agent) |
|---|---|---|
| **create** | define the type + its queue | an agent is brought up; it polls the class's queue (requires the class to exist) |
| **enable** | open entry: accepts new items; pending work is processed | the agent resumes / starts polling |
| **disable** | close entry: does not accept new items; **keeps draining** pending work (policy A) | the agent stops polling (pauses); its class and queue are untouched; other agents keep running |
| **destroy** | **armageddon:** removes the class + its queue + **all** its instances | the agent dies (that instance only) |

### 4.1 Policy A — "disable the class" (confirmed)

Disabling a class means:

- The class's **queue stops accepting new items**.
- Its instances **keep processing the pending work** until drained.
- Re-enabling reopens entry. Nothing is lost, nothing is paused.

Disabling a class does **not** pause its instances; they keep draining.

### 4.2 Enable-by-dependencies (creation rule, confirmed)

A class is enabled at creation **only if all of its dependencies exist and are
enabled**. Otherwise (a dependency is missing or disabled) the class is created
**but disabled**.

- Creating a class does **not** create its dependencies in cascade (see §7
  dependencies). Only the existing ones are evaluated.
- Enabling a class whose dependencies are missing/disabled is a **conscious**
  operator decision, never automatic: it risks a queue that fills without
  anything processing it.
- Instances inherit the state of their class: if the class is born disabled, its
  instances are born disabled too.

### 4.3 Pool as a creation parameter (confirmed)

Creating a class takes the **pool size (number of instances) as a parameter**
(default `pool_size=1`):

- `.pool_size > 0` and dependencies satisfied → class is enabled, instances
  created (enabled).
- `.pool_size == 0` → class is born **disabled** (consistent with the corollary,
  §4.4), even if dependencies are satisfied. `0` is the explicit way to create a
  class without instances (leaving it to be brought up later).
- A class born disabled for dependency reasons: its instances, if any, are born
  disabled (ready to be enabled once dependencies are satisfied).

"Create class" is separated from "bring up instances": the bootstrap does both
(passing each class's `pool_size`), the dynamic operator may do either.

### 4.4 Corollary — no instances ⇒ class disabled (confirmed)

- **If a class has no instances, the class is automatically disabled** (there is
  nobody to process).
- **Brings up instances does not by itself enable a class**: a class is enabled
  only when its **dependencies are satisfied (§4.2)** and it **has instances
  (§4.3)**. A class disabled for dependency reasons stays disabled even after
  the first instance is brought up (its instances are born disabled too).
- **Option 2 — bringing up instances of a disabled class is allowed.** Instances
  may be created of a disabled class, to **drain / scale** the pending work.
  New instances of a disabled class receive no new work; they only help drain
  what is already queued (consistent with policy A).
- **Destroying all instances ≠ destroying the class.** The class keeps existing
  (spec + queue) but is disabled. Useful for dynamic resource management:
  bring up many instances, let them drain/work, destroy them, the class rests
  disabled; bring up instances again later to re-activate. The definition, queue
  and spec persist — nothing needs to be re-defined.
- **Effective state is derived on reads (safety net).** The stored state is a
  mirror of what the `Runtime` recorded; but `class_state()` / `list_classes()`
  report the **effective state**: `enabled` only if stored `enabled` **and** the
  class has at least one recorded instance. This makes the "no instances ⇒
  disabled" corollary hold atomically on the read side (no crash window between
  `remove_instance` and `set_class_state`, §5.7), while the stored record keeps
  the explicit decision for future re-enabling: bringing up instances does
  **not** auto-enable (the stored state stays `disabled` until the operator
  enables). Dependencies are **not** part of this derivation — an operator's
  conscious enable with missing deps (§4.2) stays enabled.

### 4.5 Destroy here, and what is not destroyed

- **Destroying an instance** only removes that agent. Class, queue, and other
  agents persist. If it was the last instance, the class becomes disabled
  (still exists).
- **Destroying a class** is the armageddon of that type: it removes the class
  (spec), its queue, and **all** its instances, irreversibly. It is an explicit,
  separate, hard operation — distinct from "destroying all instances".

### 4.6 Destroy parameter: `now` / `drain` (confirmed)

Destruction always happens **in hot** (never in the bootstrap) and is always an
armageddon of the class. It takes a parameter:

- **`now`** — everything goes immediately: spec, queue, all instances, including
  any pending / in-lease items. The operator must be conscious of the loss.
- **`drain`** — the class is destroyed **once nothing is pending** (it waits for
  its queue to drain before removing spec + queue + instances). Preserves no-loss.
  **`drain` is the default.**

**`drain` semantics (confirmed 2026-08-30):** the queue stays in place until it is
empty; the guarantee is that it **does not grow** (the entry gate is closed, so
nothing new enters); if everything works normally it will eventually finish. A
**large timeout** guards the wait as a safety valve (`drain` and the timeout must
be human-scale, not a busy loop — rule 8): on the (unexpected) expiry the
operation **fails visibly** (rule 9) leaving the class untouched, and the operator
decides what to do (fix the class, or escalate to `now`). A `drain` that never
terminates is therefore always an operator-visible problem, never a silent hang.

By default, destroying all instances of a class only disables it (it persists);
the destructive armageddon (removing the class entirely) is the explicit,
separate operation above.

### 4.7 The YAML and the local cache (confirmed)

- **Creating / re-creating a class is always driven by its YAML spec** (the
  spec shape is defined in §4.10).
- The **runtime YAML cache is owned by the `AgentRegistry`** (§0): it keeps the
  spec of every class that has actually been loaded. If a class is destroyed
  and the node has **not** been restarted, it can be re-created from the cached
  YAML (the operator does not have to re-supply it). The cache is lost when the
  node restarts; the bootstrap **rebuilds the initial state and the initial
  cache** from the catalog.
- The cache is a **mirror of facts**: a spec enters the cache only **after** its
  class was actually created (the fact "the spec was read/loaded" happened), and
  it **persists across `destroy_class`** (the class leaves the live catalog but
  its spec stays cached so it can be recreated).
- **Disabling does not touch the YAML** — the spec stays (in cache / catalog).
- **Destroying removes the class** (queue + instances + active spec), **but the
  YAML is kept**, so someone can re-create it later.
- The cache holds **definitions only** — it does **not** record *why* a class
  was disabled (the "reason / by whom"), which is not stored at all.
- **Which operation requires the YAML:** only **create / re-create**. Disable and
  destroy take only the class name (plus the `now`/`drain` parameter for
  destroy); they never use the YAML.

### 4.8 The `AgentRegistry` (confirmed) and who does what

The `AgentRegistry` owns the **runtime state of agent classes** — the live
catalog and the runtime YAML cache (§0, §4.7). It is the **posterior mirror**:
entries are written only after the corresponding fact occurred. It does **not**
materialize, run or destroy anything — that is the `TaskManager`'s job,
orchestrated by the `Runtime`. Its operations fall into two groups:

- **The `Runtime` exposes every lifecycle operation** (it is the public face,
  §6). For each, it (1) asks the `TaskManager` to perform the real action, and
  (2) only after success asks the `AgentRegistry` to **record the fact**.
- **The `AgentRegistry` records and answers queries**; it never initiates.

**Registry operations (all posteriori — the fact must have occurred first):**

| Operation | What the `AgentRegistry` records (posteriori) |
|---|---|
| `record_class(name, kind, *, dependencies, queue, state)` | The class entry **after** its queue was created (the class's existence fact, §5.2). Bind kind. Unknown kind → error before anything is recorded. A class in the catalog reflects a real, materialized class. |
| `cache_spec(name, yaml)` | The YAML, **once**, at `record_class` time (→ §4.7 cache). Never per-instance. |
| `record_instance(class_name, instance_id, *, state)` | One entry per agent actually brought up **and running** — the agent's own identity, recorded after the fact; never a `pool_size` promise. Count = sum of real facts. |
| `set_class_state(name, enabled\|disabled)` | A class state change that actually took effect. Unknown class → error (rule 9). |
| `set_instance_state(class_name, instance_id, enabled\|disabled)` | An instance activity change that actually took effect (the pause/resume transitions, §5.3/§5.5). Unknown instance → error (rule 9). |
| `remove_instance(class_name, instance_id)` | An instance whose agent was actually destroyed (confirmed terminal, §5.7/§5.8). |
| `remove_class(name)` | The class entry of a class whose spec and queue were actually destroyed (armageddon); the YAML stays cached (§4.7). |

**Identity and ordering rules (mirror):**
- `instance_id` is the **agent's own identity** (the concrete agent of the
  class), **never** a TM `task_id`: an agent is not a task. The task that
  executes the fact (the agent's loop, §6.1) has its own `task_id`; the catalog
  records the agent, not the task — there is **no** 1:1 instance ↔ task identity
  mapping, and no duplicated field.
- Within a create, the order is fixed:
  **queue created (Runtime fact) → `record_class` + `cache_spec` → per agent:
  brought up & confirmed running (TM) → `record_instance`** (§5.1/§5.2).
  A class is never recorded without a queue; an instance is never recorded
  before its agent is running; `record_instance` never precedes
  `record_class` (no orphan instances).
- **Confirmation is a TM read.** Every mutation waits for the TaskManager's
  observable state — `status(task_id)` `running` for a create; `tm_control`
  `run`/`pause` for enable/disable; a terminal state for destroy — before the
  `record_*`/`set_*`/`remove_*` call. The Runtime translates task-language facts
  into catalog records.

**Queries (granular, read-only — the `Runtime` delegates these):**

| Query | Returns |
|---|---|
| `list_classes()` | existing class names and their **effective** state (§4.4) |
| `class_state(name)` | the class's **effective** state — existence + activity (`None` if it does not exist) |
| `class_dependencies(name)` | the class's direct dependencies |
| `class_dependents(name, *, transitive=False)` | the class's direct dependents (inverse of the graph), or the **transitive** upward set (the cascade of §7) |
| `dependencies_satisfied(name)` | all direct dependencies exist and are enabled — read helper for the create/enable rules (§4.2/§4.3) |
| `list_instances(class_name)` | the class's instances and their state |
| `get_instance(class_name, instance_id)` | one instance record (does it exist, and in what state?) |
| `get_cached_spec(name)` | the cached YAML for `recreate_class` |

**Idempotence and error policy:**
- Recording a class/instance that already exists → **no-op**.
- Removing a non-existent class/instance → **no-op**.
- `set_class_state` / `set_instance_state` on a non-existent entry → **error**
  (rule 9): a `set` on something that does not exist would record a false fact;
  the `Runtime` shields the operator with a "not found / no-op" reply before
  calling.
- `cache_spec` is an **upsert**.

**Kind binding:** a fixed map `{"linguistic", "tool", "sequence", "parallel"}`
→ concrete agent class. An unrecognized kind → clear error before anything is
recorded.

#### CLI (public face = the Runtime)

The CLI talks to the **Runtime**, not to the registry directly. Each command is a
Runtime high-level operation that performs the fact (via the `TaskManager`) and
then records it (in the `AgentRegistry`), posteriori (§0).

```text
legio agent create-class <spec.yaml> [--pool N]        # Runtime.create_class
legio agent recreate-class <name> [--pool N]           # Runtime.recreate_class
legio agent enable-class <name>                        # Runtime.enable_class
legio agent disable-class <name>                       # Runtime.disable_class
legio agent destroy-class <name> [--mode drain|now] # Runtime.destroy_class (default: drain)
legio agent create-instance <class> [--count N]        # Runtime.create_instance
legio agent destroy-instance <class> [--count N]       # Runtime.destroy_instance
legio agent enable-instance <class> <id>               # Runtime.enable_instance
legio agent disable-instance <class> <id>              # Runtime.disable_instance

legio agent list-classes                               # Runtime → registry (read)
legio agent class-deps <name>                          # Runtime → registry (read)
legio agent class-dependents <name>                    # Runtime → registry (read)
legio agent class-state <name>                         # Runtime → registry (read)
legio agent list-instances <class>                     # Runtime → registry (read)
```

The CLI is a thin wrapper over the **Runtime** — no new logic. Idempotence follows
the registry (create of existing / destroy of non-existent → "ok", no-op).
`recreate_class` is **create driven by the cached YAML** (`get_cached_spec`):
precondition — the class does **not** exist (it was destroyed earlier, §4.7).
Plain text output by default.

#### HTTP API (public face = the Runtime)

The HTTP surface also exposes the **Runtime**. Read operations delegate to the
`AgentRegistry`; mutation operations perform the fact (via `TaskManager`) and
then record it (Registry), posteriori.

| Method | Path | Body | → Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/agent/class` | `{spec}`(YAML), `{pool}` | `create_class` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/recreate` | `{pool}` | `recreate_class` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/enable` | — | `enable_class` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/disable` | — | `disable_class` |
| DELETE | `/agent/class/{name}` | `{mode?: drain\|now}` (default: `drain`) | `destroy_class` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/instance` | `{count}` | `create_instance` |
| DELETE | `/agent/class/{name}/instance` | `{count}` | `destroy_instance` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/instance/{id}/enable` | — | `enable_instance` |
| POST | `/agent/class/{name}/instance/{id}/disable` | — | `disable_instance` |
| GET | `/agent/class` | — | `Runtime→registry: list_classes` |
| GET | `/agent/class/{name}/dependencies` | — | `Runtime→registry: class_dependencies` |
| GET | `/agent/class/{name}/dependents` | — | `Runtime→registry: class_dependents` |
| GET | `/agent/class/{name}/state` | — | `Runtime→registry: class_state` |
| GET | `/agent/class/{name}/instance` | — | `Runtime→registry: list_instances` |

Responses are JSON. `201` on a real create/recreate; `200` on enable/disable and
queries. Idempotent like the registry: create of an existing class → `200` with a
note ("already exists", not `409`); destroy of a non-existent class → `200`
("not found, no-op"). Real errors (invalid kind, broken YAML) → `400`/`422`.

Also a thin wrapper — no extra logic.

### 4.10 The pattern schema (S1) — one agent spec, mandatory contracts, terse call

> **Reconciled against §4.11 Schema 1 (Session 14).** The old draft's `children`,
> `emit`, `bind` and `{from:}` vocabulary is **not** approved (maintainer
> ruling). This section now states the reconciled S1: `sequence`/`parallel`,
> terse tool `parameters`, mandatory symmetric contracts, no magic composition.
> §4.11 Schema 1 is the compact normative reference; this section expands it.

A pattern is **YAML data** (rule 7) defining **agents** — the only first-class
notion of this design. There is **one** agent specification shared by every
agent (tool, linguistic, sequence, parallel); the kinds differ only in their
**interior** — what executes — never in their contract or in how they are wired
into a flow. The pattern **declares**; the code resource defines the tool's
signature; Schema 3 (`available_tools`) maps name → implementation + policy.
The shape language inside the schemas supports
string/number/integer/boolean/array/object, `required`, `properties` and
`default`. The reference model's flat read + `output_as` namespacing is
inherited as *read semantics*, but S1 replaces its implicit names with declared
aliases (§4.10.2) and its `inputs` projection with the terse `parameters` call
(§4.10.4). No consumer domain, code name or resource contract appears in a
pattern (rule 7).

#### 4.10.1 The schema (one specification for every agent)

```yaml
type: atomic | composite                      # root discriminator; exactly these two
kind: tool | linguistic | sequence | parallel # second, explicit, cross-validated
name: <id>
description: <text>                           # optional
main: bool                                    # optional; root capability, NOT position

# Entry contract — MANDATORY for every agent
input_as: <alias>                             # names the incoming payload space; no magic word
input_type: text | json | binary
input_schema:                                 # mandatory (all agents; text has no schema)
  type: object
  required: [<var>]
  properties:
    <var>: {type: string|number|integer|boolean|array|object, default: <literal>}

# Output contract — MANDATORY for every agent
output_as: <alias>                            # names the deposited payload space
output_type: text | json | binary
output_schema:                                # mandatory (all agents; text has no schema)

# Interior — exactly one, by kind
tool: <available_tools-key>                   # kind: tool; the CALL + the code's signature
parameters:                                   # kind: tool; terse call (§4.10.4)
  <arg>: <dotted.path | literal>              #   no {from:}, {value:}, {default:}
prompt: "<template with {var}>"               # kind: linguistic
sequence: [ ... ]                             # kind: sequence (refs pattern:<name> or inline w/ name)
parallel: [ ... ]                             # kind: parallel (children bind only from input_as)
```

**Branch-exclusive fields, structurally enforced.** `type: atomic` → `kind:
tool` or `kind: linguistic`; `type: composite` → `kind: sequence` or `kind:
parallel`. A tool branch cannot carry `prompt`; a linguistic branch cannot
carry `tool`; atomic kinds are exclusive (a step is either a tool or a prompt —
never both). Crossed `type × kind`, a missing `kind`, both work keys on one
atomic, `parallel`+`sequence` together, a schema on a `text` type, a tool
without `tool`, or a linguistic without `prompt` are rejected at parse.
Discriminated union — nothing is inferred by key presence.

#### 4.10.2 Mandatory symmetric contracts

Every agent — atomic or composite, tool, linguistic, sequence or parallel —
declares an **entry contract** (what it consumes: `input_as`, `input_type`,
`input_schema`) and an **output contract** (what it produces: `output_as`,
`output_type`, `output_schema`). The full triples are **mandatory for every
agent**, with strict symmetry and no exceptions (addendum T #1). `input_type`/
`output_type` ∈ {text, json, binary} decide **where a value lives**: text → the
payload *is* the string; json → values are fields of the declared schema;
binary → the payload is the blob (or its reference). A `text` payload has no
schema. Schemas validate at the boundary (rule 9), and the contracts make
**composability checkable**: a use's `parameters`/`sequence` must satisfy the
used agent's entry contract, and every agent's output becomes a producer for
its scope's chain.

**Composition is contract compatibility, not exact subset (maintainer
precision, addendum AY).** The relationship between a step's input and a
(previous) step's output is **not** that one is an *exact subset* of the other.
It is **contract compatibility**: the consuming step's entry contract must be
*satisfiable* by what the producer's output guarantees — the fields it consumes
exist with the promised types. `fetch` yields `{body: string}`; a following step
whose contract demands `{url: string}` cannot consume it (composability check
fails), while one demanding `{body: string}` can.

**`input_as` is the anti-convention rule.** The first segment of every read is
a **declared alias** — a node's `input_as` or a producer's `output_as` — never
a reserved word such as "input". Because it is mandatory and declared, a loader
can resolve and verify every reference; an unresolved alias or path is a **load
error** (rule 9), never a silent convention.

#### 4.10.3 The terse call vocabulary

A tool's `parameters` value is **exactly one** of: a **plain dotted path** (a
producer reference, resolved against the chain, §4.10.4), or a **literal** (a
value fixed in this pattern/call). There is no `{from:}`, `{value:}` or
`{default:}` wrapper — those verbosity forms are not approved; the default lives
in the code's signature and is **never written**. A dotted path resolves against
**the whole chain that precedes the node in its scope** — the encapsulating
composite's `input_as` or the `output_as` of **any** earlier child of that
scope, not only the immediate predecessor. `.path` must exist in the producer's
declared `output_schema`, and the producer's output type must be statically
assignable to the consuming variable. Literal values need no producer. Failures
are load errors.

#### 4.10.4 Interior and its coherence with the contract

- **Tool.** `tool: <name>` selects a Schema-3 `available_tools` resource;
  `parameters:` is the **terse call** — each parameter of the executed code's
  signature is a dotted path (resolve against the chain, §4.10.3) or a literal;
  never `{from:}`/`{value:}`/`{default:}`; omitted means the code's default.
  The tool's `input_schema` must be a valid subset of the registered signature —
  checked at load against the registry, so the declared contract can never be
  fiction. Static (load) verification is the flow-against-itself; verification
  against the tool's signature is execution-time (Schema 3).
- **Linguistic.** `prompt:` is a template whose `{var}` placeholders **are**
  the entry contract: every template variable must exist in `input_schema` and
  every declared variable must be used or flagged. The output contract is a
  declaration, not a code signature — it must be **enforced at runtime**
  (structured output / validation against `output_schema`), or the contract is
  a promise that nothing checks (rule 9).
- **Composites.** `sequence:`/`parallel:` are references (`pattern: <name>`) or
  full inline nodes (must carry `name`). A sequence lists the ordered classes of
  its level; a parallel lists its branches. There is no `emit:` and no
  "last child renamed": **how a composite combines its children's results into
  its own output is the agent's implementation** (P-A ruling, addendum AT), and
  the declared `output_as`/`output_schema` is the contract that implementation
  must satisfy.

#### 4.10.5 Reuse belongs to every definition, and encapsulation

Any agent — atomic or composite — is defined once, **source-agnostic**, and is
**wired at the usage site**: a composite references it with `pattern: <name>`
and its `parameters`/`sequence`/`parallel` resolve each required input to a
source of its own chain (§4.10.3). The same definition used in different
composites can bind the same variables to different producers; the interior
never changes. The **same agent may appear more than once in a flow by
position** — distinguished by `current_index` — unless inside its own
definition (cycle → infinite recursion, rejected at catalog load). Reuse is
constrained by **contract composability** (§4.10.2): repeated identical steps
only chain if each one's entry contract is satisfiable by the previous output,
so the apparent ``output_as`` collision dissolves (addendum AX). The used
agent's contract is kept: keys are a subset of its declared properties,
`required` covered unless a `default` exists, extras are load errors; the used
agent's `output_as` becomes a producer for later siblings.

Encapsulation: an agent's interior is **opaque** — a consumer sees only its
`output_as`/`output_schema`, never its internal names (those are checked
against the agent's own scope). **`output_as` is unique within its scope**
(collision = load error). Composition **cycles** (an agent transitively
containing itself) are detected at catalog load and rejected.

#### 4.10.6 Composite output (no `emit`)

A composite declares its output contract (`output_as`/`output_type`/
`output_schema`) up front. **How** it produces that output from its children's
results is **the agent's implementation** (P-A ruling, addendum AT) — there is
no `emit:` map and no "last child renamed" rule. A sequence runs its ordered
classes and its implementation assembles the declared output; a parallel fans
out to its branches, gathers their results on its gathering queue, and its
implementation assembles the declared output from them. The contract is the
guarantee the implementation must satisfy; nothing more is specified.

A parallel's children bind **only** from the composite's `input_as`; any serial
dependency between branches is expressed as a `sequence` nested inside a branch
(no hidden ordering, no races).

#### 4.10.7 `main` = root capability, not position

`main: true` marks an agent as a valid `submit` entry. At submit the flow is
seeded on the `main` agent in **level 1** with `end_of_level_queue` set to the
**final-result queue** (Schema 2; addendum AM). A `main` agent may also appear
in the middle of another DAG (`pattern: <name>`): there it executes its
functionality as part of the enclosing flow and advances, returning to the
client only when the flow started at it. A catalog may declare several `main`
agents. `main` never changes the contract or the calling mechanism; it is
identity/capability, not position.

#### 4.10.8 Checkable composability (redundancy against the silent)

Because every agent declares its entry and output contracts, the loader
verifies the catalog statically: every `parameters`/`sequence`/`parallel`
reference resolves against a declared producer in the chain; every use satisfies
the used agent's entry contract with statically compatible types; `output_as`
names are unique per scope; interiors cohere with their contracts (vocabulary
above); and there are no cycles. A catalog with an invalid spec **fails at
load** (rule 9; LEG-071 dry-run) — nothing silently miswired ever runs.

## 4.11 The three schemas — current reviewed state (S1 pattern · S2 token · S3 tools)

> **Status.** This section records the schemas **as they stand now** (Session 14,
> reviewed in-session, journals 2026-08-31 addenda AB–AP). They are the agreed
> vocabulary and are expected to be **revised after the S4 simulation** if it
> exposes defects. `§4.10` above has been **reconciled** against this section and
> the addenda K/M/N (no more `emit`/`bind`/`children`). The S4 simulation (run
> 1–4, addenda AS–AZ) exposed **no remaining problems**; the vocabulary below
> stands validated. English-only, per AGENTS.md.

### Schema 1 — the agent pattern (S1)

One spec for every agent, symmetric mandatory contracts. Approved vocabulary
(addenda K/L/M/N; `emit`/`bind`/`children` are NOT approved):

```yaml
type: atomic | composite        # root discriminator, exactly these two
kind: tool | linguistic | sequence | parallel
name: <id>
main: bool                      # root capability (identity), NOT position
# entry contract — MANDATORY for every agent
input_as: <alias>               # names the incoming payload space (anti-convention)
input_type: text | json | binary
input_schema:                   # mandatory (json: object with required/properties)
# output contract — MANDATORY for every agent
output_as: <alias>              # names the deposited payload space (destination)
output_type: text | json | binary
output_schema:                  # mandatory (json: object with required/properties)
# interior — by kind
tool: <available_tools-key>     # kind: tool; the CALL and the code's signature
parameters:                     # kind: tool; arg -> dotted.path | literal (no from/value/default)
prompt: "<template with {var}>" # kind: linguistic
sequence: [ ... ]               # kind: sequence (refs pattern:<name> or inline with name)
parallel: [ ... ]               # kind: parallel (children bind only from input_as of the composite)
```

- Contract of entry and output are **mandatory for every agent** — atomic and
  composite, tool/linguistic/sequence/parallel — the full triples
  (`as`/`type`/`schema`), strict symmetry, no exceptions (addendum T #1).
- Cross `type × kind`, missing `kind`, both work-keys on one atomic,
  `parallel`+`sequence` together, schema on a `text` type, tool without `tool`,
  linguistic without `prompt`, prompt+tool — rejected at parse.
- **Reuse:** a definition is unique; each use in a composite is a distinct node.
  Same-class agents may appear more than once in a flow (by position), unless in
  their own definition (cycle → infinite recursion, rejected at catalog load,
  §4.10.5 / addendum AE).
- **ToolAgent `parameters` is the CALL, terse:** `parameters: {arg: dotted.path
  | literal}` — no `{from:}`, `{value:}`, `{default:}`; the default lives in the
  code's signature and is never written. The tool names its resource via
  `tool: <name>`; the name must exist in Schema 3's `available_tools`.

### Schema 2 — the token/message that travels between class queues (S4-proposed)

Settled token fields (addenda AG–AM). No `next_queue` — the next step is derived
by position. No results store — the final destination is the final-result queue.

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | int, `1000`; mismatch → reject. |
| `level_route` | tuple of classes — the route of this level (a branch or sub-sequence). |
| `current_index` | int, 0-based position of the class processing in `level_route` (advance `+1` = next). |
| `end_of_level_queue` | queue at the end of this level's sequence — created by the **submit** (final-result queue) or by a **parallel** (its gathering queue). |
| `level` | branch-depth counter: starts at 1; branching +1; leaving a branch −1. End-of-sequence AND `level == 1` ⇒ flow finished. |
| `launcher_class` | class of the agent that started the flow; constant, informational, not control. |
| `task_id` | str, the process's public id. |
| `message_type` | enum `execution_request` \| `execution_result`. |
| `payload` | the data (single container for both roles). |

- **Advance (request):** `current_index < len(level_route)-1` → deliver `payload`
  to class `level_route[current_index+1]` (by position, no next_queue field).
- **End-of-level:** `current_index == len(level_route)-1` → deliver to
  `end_of_level_queue`.
- **Flow end:** end-of-sequence AND `level == 1` ⇒ final: deliver to
  `end_of_level_queue` (= the final-result queue set by the submit). Nothing more
  is routed.
- **Parallel (branching):** a parallel class receives its request and does not
  advance while its branches run; it fans out giving each branch its `level_route`
  and `current_index = 0`, incrementing `level` (+1). Branches return to the
  parallel's **gathering queue** via their `end_of_level_queue`. On fan-in
  completion the parallel decrements `level` (−1) and resumes its own level
  (`current_index + 1` → next of its level), with `end_of_level_queue` the one its
  creator supplied.
- **Parallel as root:** submit passes its sequence as level 1 with
  `end_of_level_queue` = final-result queue; branches run at level 2 with
  gathering; after fan-in the parallel advances its level-1 sequence with the
  submit's final-result queue (addendum AM).
- **`root`** lives in the FlowToken (subclassing the message), not in the queue
  message; `end_of_level_queue` = final-result queue is the store-free return
  (there is no "results store"). The agent does not decide where to deposit —
  who creates the flow assigns the class queue; the information lives always in
  the token (addenda AJ/AL).

### Schema 3 — the tools declaration (S2)

Each tool is an independent, autosufficient resource; it does **not** know which
agents use it (no coupling). The tool identifier is the explicit `available_tools`
key, and that name is the bridge used later in the agent's `tool: <name>`.

```yaml
available_tools:
  <name>:
    implementation: <dotted.path.to.resource>
    policy: { timeout: <seconds per call>, retries: <call retries> }
```

- A tool does **not** declare its output capacity — the consuming agents
  declare the output via `output_as`/`output_schema` (S2 ruling).
- Static (load) verification is the flow-against-itself; verification against the
  tool (its signature/parameters) is execution-time (dynamically loaded).

## 5. Flows (states explicit at every step)

Conventions: class state = existence + activity; instance state = existence +
activity; "polls/drains" = an enabled agent consuming its class's queue.

**Who does each flow (all of §5):** every mutation flow follows the same split —
the **Runtime** (public face, the authority that creates/destroys/enables/
disables agents) exposes and orchestrates; it asks the **TaskManager** to
perform the real fact (bring up/destroy an agent, start/stop its loop); and
**only after** that fact is confirmed it asks the **AgentRegistry** to **record
it** (§0, registration-is-a-mirror). **Confirmation is a TM read** (§4.8) — every
mutation waits for the observable state (`status(task_id)` `running` on create;
`tm_control` `run`/`pause` on enable/disable; a terminal state on destroy) before
the `record_*`/`set_*`/`remove_*` call. The class **entry gate** is not a
TaskManager fact — it is the Runtime's own submission-side check against the
catalog (§5.6, §6.1). The state tables below describe the resulting transitions;
they happen *after* the fact, never before. Reads ("verify the class exists")
always go to the `AgentRegistry`.
There is **no** separate "instance supervisor" — bringing up agents is the
Runtime's orchestration over the TaskManager.

### 5.1 Create instance
Precondition: the class exists. Bringing up an instance does **not** by itself
enable the class (enablement comes from dependencies satisfied + having
instances, §4.2/§4.4); instances of a disabled class are born disabled.

| # | Action | Class | Instance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Verify the class exists (read) | created (enabled or disabled) | — |
| 2 | Bring up the agent: its own loop starts running on the class's queue; wait until `running` (TM read) | unchanged | agent running |
| 3 | Record the instance with the class's **effective** state — born `disabled` if the class is disabled (§4.2/§4.4); initial control `run` (enabled) or `pause` (disabled) | unchanged | `created / disabled` or `created / enabled` |
| 4 | (corollary) having instances is a precondition for the class being enabled, but does not enable it on its own | unchanged | — |

How: **Runtime** → `TaskManager` executes the fact (the callable that is the
agent's internal loop, §6.1) and confirms `status(task_id) == running` (TM read)
→ on success **Runtime** → `AgentRegistry` `record_instance(class, instance_id,
born_state)` (posteriori). If the agent never reaches `running` — nothing is
recorded (the mirror never reports an agent that was not actually brought up).

**No instance supervisor** — the Runtime orchestrates this (§5 convention).

### 5.2 Create class
Precondition: the class does not exist. Creation takes `pool_size` as a
parameter and evaluates dependencies; it does **not** create dependencies in
cascade.

| # | Action | Class | Instances / Queue |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create the type's queue (Runtime fact) | `created / disabled` | queue created (accepts nothing while disabled) |
| 2 | `record_class(name, kind, deps, queue, state)` + `cache_spec(name, yaml)` (posteriori, once) | `created / disabled` | — |
| 3 | Evaluate dependencies (all exist and are enabled?) and `pool_size` | (see below) | — |
| 4 | If all dependencies satisfied and `pool_size > 0`: per agent — bring it up, confirm `running`, `record_instance` (enabled) | `created / enabled` | instances created / enabled |
| 5 | Else (a dependency missing/disabled, or `pool_size == 0`): born disabled; instances, if any, born disabled | `created / disabled` | instances, if created by pool, `created / disabled` |

How: **Runtime** creates the type's queue (fact) → `record_class` + `cache_spec`
(posteriori to the queue, **once per class**) → for each agent of the pool, asks
the **TaskManager** to execute its fact (the agent's loop, one at a time) and
confirms `running` → on each success **Runtime** → **AgentRegistry**
`record_instance` (posteriori). The catalog count is the **sum of real facts**,
never a `pool_size` promise.

### 5.3 Enable instance
Precondition: the instance exists and is disabled.

| # | Action | Class | Instance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resume the agent's loop | unchanged | `created / enabled` |

How: **Runtime** → **TaskManager** resumes that agent's loop
(`resume(task_id)`) and confirms `tm_control == run` (TM read; fact) → on success
**Runtime** → **AgentRegistry** `set_instance_state(enabled)` (posteriori).

### 5.4 Enable class
Precondition: the class exists and is disabled. Enabling is a **conscious**
operator action. If the class's dependencies are not satisfied, the operator
accepts the risk of a queue filling without anything processing it (§4.2).

| # | Action | Class | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Check the class has at least one instance; if none, bring one up | — | created / disabled (then enabled) |
| 2 | Mark the class enabled (queue accepts new items again) | `created / enabled` | — |
| 3 | Resume **all** the class's instances | unchanged | enabled, draining |

Rule (§4.2/§4.3, symmetric): `enable_class` resumes **all** the class's
instances. The registry does not record *why* an instance was paused (§7), so an
explicit `disable_instance` of a single agent is a one-shot pause that the next
`enable_class` clears.

How: **Runtime** (conscious decision) → ensures an agent exists (via **TaskManager**,
confirmed `running`, recorded **posteriori** in **AgentRegistry**) → resumes
**all** instances (per-instance `resume`, `tm_control` `run`) → **AgentRegistry**
`set_instance_state(enabled)` for each + `set_class_state(enabled)` after the
facts hold.

### 5.5 Disable instance
Precondition: the instance exists and is enabled.

| # | Action | Class | Instance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pause the agent (release its lease safely, at-least-once) | unchanged | `created / disabled` |

How: **Runtime** → **TaskManager** pauses that single agent's loop
(`pause(task_id)`, release lease, at-least-once) and confirms
`tm_control == pause` (TM read; fact) → on success **Runtime** → **AgentRegistry**
`set_instance_state(disabled)` (posteriori). Unlike disable-class, here **one
specific agent is stopped**.

### 5.6 Disable class (policy A)
Precondition: the class exists and is enabled.

| # | Action | Class | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mark the class disabled (queue stops accepting new items) | `created / disabled` | — |
| 2 | Instances keep draining the pending work | unchanged | enabled, draining (not paused) |
| 3 | Cascade-disable dependents (those that reference it) | dependents become `created / disabled` | — |

How (policy A): **Runtime** decides `disable_class`: from then on, its submit
path **rejects new items** against the catalog (the entry gate, §6.1) →
**AgentRegistry** `set_class_state(disabled)` records the fact → the agents are
**not touched** — they keep draining the pending work → for each dependent
(transitive), the Runtime gate applies and **AgentRegistry** marks it disabled,
agents still draining. **disable ≠ destroy**: disable closes entry, never kills
agents.

### 5.7 Destroy instance
Precondition: the instance exists.

| # | Action | Class | Instance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Terminate the agent (release its loop and lease) | unchanged | `does not exist` |
| 2 | (corollary) if it was the last instance, the class becomes disabled | `created / disabled` | — |

How: **Runtime** → **TaskManager** destroys that agent's loop (`cancel(task_id)`)
and confirms a terminal state (`failed(cancelled)` / `failed(executor_died)`)
(TM read; fact) → on success **Runtime** → **AgentRegistry** `remove_instance`
(posteriori); if it was the last instance, `set_class_state(disabled)` — and reads
report it via the **effective state** (§4.4) even across the two records.

### 5.8 Destroy class (armageddon)
Precondition: the class exists. Always in hot. Parameter `now` or `drain`
(**default: `drain`**, §4.6).

| # | Action | Class | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resolve parameter (`drain`: wait until queue empty, §4.6; `now`: proceed) | unchanged | unchanged |
| 2 | Destroy all its instances | unchanged | all `does not exist` |
| 3 | Destroy the queue | unchanged | — |
| 4 | Remove the spec from the catalog | `does not exist` | — |
| 5 | Cascade-disable dependents (they reference a destroyed class) | dependents become `created / disabled` | — |

Notes:
- **Down (dependencies) is not touched**: the classes this one depends on are
  never destroyed or disabled here, because others may depend on them.
- **Up (dependents)**: classes that reference the destroyed class are disabled
  (cascade, §7) — they remain existing but disabled, never destroyed by the
  cascade.

How: **Runtime** resolves `mode` (`drain` waits until queue empty; `now`
proceeds) → for each agent: **TaskManager** `cancel(task_id)` and confirm
terminal (fact) → **AgentRegistry** `remove_instance` (posteriori) → the Runtime
removes the queue and its entry gate and the **AgentRegistry** `remove_class`
(the YAML stays in the Registry's cache) → cascade-disable dependents (Runtime
gate + AgentRegistry `set_class_state(disabled)`; their agents keep draining).
**Down (dependencies) is never touched.** Irreversible.

## 6. Responsibilities (who owns what)

The lifecycle splits across the three layers described in §0:

- **`Runtime` (only layer with initiative, public face)** — decides every
  lifecycle operation, exposes it (CLI / HTTP / programmatic), and orchestrates
  the other two. For each mutation it asks the `TaskManager` to perform the real
  fact and, **only after success**, asks the `AgentRegistry` to record it
  (registration-is-a-mirror). It validates reads against the `AgentRegistry`.
  Functions: `create_class`, `recreate_class`, `create_instance`,
  `destroy_instance`, `enable_class`, `disable_class`, `destroy_class`,
  `enable_instance`, `disable_instance`, and the read queries.
- **`AgentRegistry` (posterior mirror, owner of the YAML cache)** — records the
  facts the `Runtime` confirms (classes, instances, state changes, specs in the
  cache) and answers the granular queries. It **never initiates, never
  materializes, never runs** anything. Governs only existence and lifecycle —
  **never the DAG or routing**.
- **`TaskManager` (executor of facts, blind to the domain)** — actually
  executes the fact, in task language: it runs the callable that is an agent's
  internal loop (creating an agent), pauses/resumes/cancels it. It does not know
  that a task is "the agent lifecycle", it never knows the DAG, and it is not
  involved in business submissions — the class entry gate belongs to the Runtime
  (§6.1).

The `TaskManager` holds the task/machine reality (the agent's life runs through
it); the `AgentRegistry` is its posterior mirror; the `Runtime` is the decision
point between them. An **agent is not a task**: the catalog records the agent by
its own identity; the TM task that executes its loop keeps a separate `task_id`
(§4.8).

**Invariant — no orphaned jobs (confirmed 2026-08-30).** A business task is
always traceable in the Runtime registries (`tasks` / and the TM's `tm_tasks`):
it either reaches a
terminal state or stays visibly pending. The only deliberate-loss path is
`destroy_class --mode now`, which is explicit and operator-chosen (§4.6). There
must never be a job that exists nowhere and is seen by no one. **If an orphan
appears, that is a design error to fix — never a runtime condition to paper
over.**

### 6.1 The `TaskManager` — minimal task surface (design)

The `TaskManager` is the **executor of facts** (§0): a reduced, domain-free task
engine on beaver. It knows only **tasks** — a task is a `name` + `args/kwargs` +
a state + an execution time. It never knows agents, classes, agent queues,
patterns, the DAG, routing or the `AgentRegistry`. Its functional reference is
`castor-io`, reduced to what legio's lifecycle needs; it is **not** castor and
**not** an engine for business tasks (business `submit`/results stay in the
Runtime, `legio.manager`).

**What a task is (domain-free).** A task is identified by `task_id` (uuid). Its
record lives on the registry `db.dict("tm_tasks")` and holds: `name`, `args`,
`kwargs`, `status`, `cancellable`, `next_run_at`, timestamps (`enqueued_at`,
`started_at`, `finished_at`), `result`, `error`, and the resilience fields
reserved for R-6 (`attempts`, `lease_expires_at`). Status is one of `pending |
running | success | failed | cancelling` (`cancelling` is the visible half-open
state of a cooperative cancel). Execution time is the `next_run_at` **field**
(rule 8 — no sleeps, no scheduler).

**Beaver footprint (all TaskManager-owned scopes):**

| Primitive | Scope | Role |
|---|---|---|
| dict | `tm_tasks` | task records (`task_id` → `TaskRecord`) |
| queue | `tm_scheduled` | task ids ordered by `next_run_at` (priority = timestamp) |
| queue | `tm_pending` | task ids due now (priority 0) |
| dict | `tm_control` | cooperative control per task: `run \| pause \| cancel` (TTL) |
| lock | `tm_lease:{task_id}` | execution lease (TTL + renew); a dead executor's lease expires and the task becomes stale to the reaper |

Result/error travel **inside the task record** — consumers poll
`status(task_id)`. There is no result queue: polling-only (rule 8).

**Surface.**

```
register(name, callable)                    # in-process: name → async fn | async generator
async submit(name, *args, *, next_run_at=None, **kwargs) -> task_id
async status(task_id) -> TaskRecord | None
async pause(task_id) / resume(task_id)      # disable ≠ destroy: non-terminal suspension
async cancel(task_id)                       # terminal, cooperative
```

- The **callable registry is in-process code**, never a registry: it is the task
  executor's execution scope (castor's `_registry`); state — the authority of what
  happened — is always a (persistent) registry.
- The Runtime **registers the callables that are the agents' internal loops**
  (each agent's `AgentBase.run`, LEG-023). To the TM each is just a callable —
  it never sees what is inside, and the callable is **not** the agent: it is the
  vehicle through which the agent's life runs. The catalog records the agent by
  its own identity, with a separate `task_id` for the task executing its loop
  (§4.8) — never a 1:1 instance ↔ task identity.

**Task-executor algorithm.** A TM task executor is a polling loop over the task
queues:

```
1. tm_scheduled.peek() → get() the due head (next_run_at <= now) → dispatch
2. else tm_pending.get(block=False) → dispatch   (IndexError ⇒ nothing due; run() returns)
3. dispatch(task_id):
   a. acquire tm_lease:{task_id} (TTL; renew while running)
   b. status := running (+ started_at, lease_expires_at)
   c. cancellable? drive the generator, checking tm_control at each yield:
        run    → advance one step
        pause  → yield without advancing (lease kept; at-least-once)
        cancel → cancelling → failed(cancelled)
      not cancellable? await callable(*args, **kwargs)
   d. success + result | failed + error   (never silent, rule 9)
   e. release the lease
```

- **Reaper (`reap`)**: a task `running` whose `lease_expires_at` is stale is
  marked `failed(executor_died)` — the mirror must show when an agent's
  executor died. Lease-based **retry** (`attempts` → re-queue) and **DLQ** are
  R-6 (LEG-060/061/062); the fields exist already.
- **Multi-process concurrency**: several TM task executors (any process) drain
  the same queues; `get()` is destructive/atomic, so a task executes once; the
  lease arbitrates the reaper in crash windows.

**Lifecycle verbs → task language.** The TM executes these facts; the Runtime
decides them and records them in the `AgentRegistry` **after** each is confirmed
(registration-is-a-mirror):

| Runtime verb | TaskManager fact (task language) | Observable TM state | Registry record (posteriori) |
|---|---|---|---|
| create_instance | `submit(agent_loop, ...)` (the agent's internal loop, long-running, cancellable) | `running` | `record_instance` |
| destroy_instance | `cancel(task_id)` | `cancelling → failed(cancelled)` | `remove_instance` |
| disable_instance | `pause(task_id)` | `tm_control=pause` (loop yields; still exists) | `set_instance_state(disabled)` |
| enable_instance | `resume(task_id)` | `tm_control=run` | `set_instance_state(enabled)` |
| create_class (pool N) | N × `submit(agent_loop, ...)` | N tasks `running` | `record_class` + N×`record_instance` + `cache_spec` |
| destroy_class | N × `cancel(...)` | all tasks terminated | N×`remove_instance` + `remove_class` |

**What the TaskManager does NOT own** (decoupling boundaries):
- The **entry gate of a class queue** (what §0/§5.6/§5.8/§6 name "dispatch"):
  submitting into a disabled class is refused by the **Runtime** (it consults
  the catalog); business submits never pass through the TM. (Resolved — see §10,
  open decision 3.)
- The DAG, routing, delivery, results: all Runtime/agent concern.
- The AgentRegistry: the TM never records anything in it.

**Compliance (audit).** Polling-only / no sleeps (rule 8), scheduling as a field
(`next_run_at`); domain-free (rule 7 — names/states only, never agents); errors
never silent (rule 9 — `failed`+`error` visible, `failed(executor_died)`,
`cancelled`); everything is a registry (rule 13 — callables are code, never
authority); logging with the implementation (rule 11); no instance supervisor
(the TM is executor only; the Runtime decides; the agent's internal cycle is the
callable's own — the agent is not a task, its identity lives in the catalog);
disable ≠ destroy (pause vs cancel); additive — the Runtime and
the agents are untouched. Implementation lands with the Runtime's lifecycle ops
(R-8), executed in task language by the TaskManager (§6.1).

## 7. Dependencies (from the YAML spec)

Dependencies come from the spec: a composite (`sequence` / `parallel`)
references other classes by name. These govern enable/disable/destroy behavior.

- **Create** evaluates its **dependencies (down)**: a class is created enabled
  only if all dependencies exist and are enabled; otherwise born disabled.
  Creation does **not** create its dependencies in cascade.
- **Disable / destroy** cascade over its **dependents (up)**: disabling or
  destroying a class disables the classes that reference it (recursively — a
  dependency cascade / chain of disablement). The cascade is **transitive
  upward**: if something depends on it, that dependent is disabled, and anything
  that depends on *that dependent* is disabled too (it will not be able to
  resolve). Dependents become `created / disabled`, never destroyed by the
  cascade.
- **Destroy does not touch down**: the classes a destroyed class depends on are
  left untouched, because others may depend on them.
- **Re-creating a class does not re-enable its dependents** automatically: the
  system does not record *why* a disablement happened (by whom: a cascade vs an
  explicit operator action), so restoring a class does not undo explicit
  decisions. Re-enabling dependents is an explicit operator decision, guided by
  the live catalog (§9), which exposes the dependency graph so the upward chain
  can be deduced.
- **Cycles** in the dependency graph (a class depends transitively on itself)
  break the topological order — they are detected and must be resolved (rejected
  / flagged) rather than silently looping.

## 8. Bootstrap — build the initial state and the initial cache

The bootstrap **constructs the initial state of the system and the initial
cache** in the `AgentRegistry` (§0). It does **not** "run tasks": it leaves the
agents idle and the node standing. The catalog holds all dependency information
(classes, instances, DAGs and states), so the full graph is known. The node is
brought up **by CLI or programmatically** (the Runtime is the entry point); the
bootstrap runs the ordering below against the loaded catalog.

Consistent with registration-is-a-mirror, **nothing is recorded before it
happens**: each entry enters the initial catalog/cache only after the fact (the
agent was actually brought up / the spec was actually read) is confirmed.

1. **Runtime** loads the source specs (classes + pool of each).
2. Build the **topological order** of the dependency graph (leaves first, then
   the classes that depend on them, etc.).
3. For each class in that order: **Runtime** creates its queue (fact) →
   `record_class` + `cache_spec` (once, posteriori to the queue) → **TaskManager**
   brings up its agents one at a time (each agent's own loop, §6.1), each
   confirmed `running` before the **Registry** records the instance
   (§5.2/§4.8 ordering). (`pool_size` is the *intent*; the catalog reflects the
   *real* count of agents actually brought up — never a promise.)
4. Because each dependency is created (enabled) before its dependents, the
   enable-by-dependencies rule (§4.2) is satisfied naturally → dependents are
   created enabled.
5. Anything whose dependencies are not satisfied stays disabled and is visible
   in the catalog (its agents, if any, are recorded but stay disabled).
6. A dependency cycle breaks the order → detected and resolved (rejected /
   flagged).
7. The agents are already running their own internal loops (each was brought up
   in step 3, §6.1); the node's task executors are up and drain the TM queues.

**Result:** the **initial catalog state** plus the **initial YAML cache** exist in
the `AgentRegistry`; agents are idle (nothing pending on their class queues);
**no business task has been started** (a task only begins when a work item
enters the starting agent's queue, Flows B/C in the execution model). The node
is ready to receive submits.

## 9. The live catalog (operator source of truth)

The catalog exposes classes, instances, DAGs and states (queues, enabled /
disabled, dependencies). The operator uses it to know what exists, what is
disabled and why, and to decide explicitly what to enable / re-enable / destroy.
No disablement-history is recorded; the live catalog is what guides decisions.

- **What the catalog exposes per class:** the class, its **direct dependencies**
  and its **dependents** (the inverse of the graph), its state, the instances it
  has, and the state of each instance. Exposed granularly via the queries in
  §4.8: `list_classes`, `class_dependencies`, `class_dependents`, `class_state`,
  `list_instances`.
- Exposing **dependents (the upward graph)** lets the operator deduce the
  cascade: when a class is disabled/destroyed, the whole transitive set of
  dependents is what got disabled, and re-enabling can walk that chain upward.
  (Even though the "by whom" is not recorded, the graph makes the candidates
  derivable.)

## 10. Open decisions and open risks

### Open decisions

1. **"Pending work" boundary / drain semantics (resolved 2026-08-30 by §4.6):**
   `now` destroys everything including **pending and in-lease** items (the
   operator consciously accepts the loss); `drain` waits for the queue to empty —
   in-flight leases keep running to completion, nothing new enters, and the
   drain completes. The queue does **not** grow, termination is eventual when
   things work, and a **large timeout** is the safety valve (visible failure on
   expiry — rule 9). No further boundary to decide.
2. **Destroy parameter default (resolved 2026-08-30):** the default is **`drain`**
   (`--mode`/`{mode}` optional in CLI/HTTP, §4.8; §5.8). `now` is the explicit
   escalation. A `drain` that never ends is an operator-visible problem, never a
   silent hang (large timeout → visible failure, §4.6).
3. **Entry gate / dispatch ownership (resolved 2026-08-30):** the class entry
   gate belongs to the **Runtime** — its submit path rejects new items against
   the catalog when the class is disabled. It is not a `TaskManager` fact (the
   TaskManager never sees business submissions, and there is no open/closed
   attribute on a beaver queue to "close"). §0/§5/§5.6/§5.8/§6 wording updated
   accordingly (reconciled thread 3).
4. **Lease reaper in the minimal TaskManager (resolved 2026-08-30):** the
   minimal TM includes the execution lease + the stale-lease →
   `failed(executor_died)` reaper. Without it the mirror would report a dead
   instance as alive — violates registration-is-a-mirror and rule 9. Retry
   (`attempts` → re-queue) and DLQ stay in R-6 (LEG-060/061/062).
5. **TaskManager scope names and placement (confirmed 2026-08-30):** module
   **`legio.taskmanager`**; class **`TaskManager`**; beaver scopes, all under the
   `tm_` prefix: `tm_tasks` (dict), `tm_scheduled` (queue), `tm_pending` (queue),
   `tm_control` (dict), `tm_lease:{task_id}` (lock). Normative in `legio.naming`
   (LEG-016) at implementation.

### Open risks

1. **The lifecycle layer must not absorb the DAG / routing** — it governs only
   existence and lifecycle. This is the central design risk.
2. **A disabled class, never re-enabled, accumulates or leaks pending work** —
   mitigate eventually via DLQ / reaper (R-6).
3. **Two state levels (class + instance) must stay coherent** — prefer that
   instances read (derive) the class state rather than the registry coordinating
   each instance individually.
4. **"Polling" means the agent's loop is scheduled / supervised** (reaper, not
   a busy loop — AGENTS.md rule 8), not a permanently active thread.
5. **The task executing an agent's loop can die outside any operator operation**
   (the agent's executor crashes → TM reaper marks `failed(executor_died)`),
   leaving a catalog instance that no longer exists and a class that *reads*
   `enabled` (or `disabled`) with zero live agents. The **effective state** read
   (§4.4) limits the damage — zero instances read as `disabled` — but the stale
   entry persists until an operator `destroy_instance`, or R-8 pooling
   reconciles/respawns it. Automatic reconciliation/respawn is **R-8 / LEG-080**
   (not part of this design).

## 11. Reference comparison

- From `voice-notes-api`: an `AgentFactory.create_all_pools` walks the compiled
  pattern catalog at boot and creates a pool per pattern, each pool being N
  replicas over the same `db.queue(pattern_name)`. Unloading / dynamic loading
  does **not** exist there.
- legio **improves** on this: the same catalog walk happens at boot, but agents
  can also be **created on the fly** (with their queue) and **destroyed** at
  runtime — without restarting the node — via the four verbs above.
- Additional legio improvements over the reference:
  - **Pool size is a creation parameter** (0 ⇒ born disabled), extending the
    reference's fixed `pool_size` per pattern.
  - **Dynamic lifecycle** governed by create / enable / disable / destroy,
    including a dependency cascade, enable-by-dependencies, and the live catalog
    as the operator's source of truth.
- Confirmed principles taken forward from the reference:
  - The **queue belongs to the type** (class), not to an instance.
  - Multiple instances of a type share and consume the **same** queue.
  - The agent that starts a task concretizes and passes the DAG; atomic agents
    only advance by position in the passed token.

## 12. Execution mechanics and the lifecycle × execution handshake

> **Reconciled against §4.11 Schema 2 (Session 14).** The old wording
> (`route_pattern_names`, `ultimate_return_agent_id`, "results store",
> `client:{task_id}` root return) is superseded. The token now carries
> `level_route` (per-level), `current_index`, `end_of_level_queue`, `level`,
> `launcher_class`; the destination is by position + `level`, and the final
> result goes to the **final-result queue** (no store, no `client:` return).

This section specifies the **runtime flow of a task** and how it meets the
class lifecycle (create / enable / disable / destroy). It is the execution
counterpart of §0-§8, and it is written so the decoupling rules cannot be
re-learned wrong: the flow is **forward-only (a DAG, per level)**, state travels
**in the message** (Schema 2 token), and the only per-class data are a queue and
(where relevant) a gathering queue and a gate — never an out-of-message
accumulator.

### 12.1 The message payload is the state: it travels in the messages/token

Each agent receives the incoming `payload`, performs its processing, and
**builds the new `payload`** that travels in the outgoing message (Schema 2)
exactly as in the reference model (`voice-notes-api`): the message carries
`payload` (the single container for both request and result roles) and the
flow fields (`level_route`, `current_index`, `end_of_level_queue`, `level`,
`launcher_class`, `task_id`, `message_type`, `schema_version`). There is **no**
store that holds per-agent/task state out of the token (see
`docs/JOURNALS/2026-08-30.md`, execution-mechanics thread); the message payload
is the state — polling-only, nothing central, nothing staged out-of-message
for later combination. `root` lives in the FlowToken (subclassing the message),
not in the queue message (Schema 2 / addendum AJ).

### 12.2 One inbox queue per class; every agent of the class polls it

- Every class has exactly **one inbox queue** (`legio:queue:<class>`); all of
  its agents (instances) poll and consume that same queue.
- Agents are **interchangeable, stateless** consumers of the unit of work the
  class knows; an agent learns *what to do, where it is, and where the level
  ends* **only from the message + token** it just consumed (Schema 2: position
  in `level_route`, `level`, and the `end_of_level_queue` the flow creator
  assigned). There is no god agent, no per-task queue, no engine driving steps.
- The **agent's internal loop** (LEG-023, `AgentBase.run`) is the unit a
  brought-up agent executes per class: poll **one** due item from the class's
  inbox (`get(block=False)` → `IndexError` = idle, returns; rule 8) and process
  it, repeating until idle. Operational control (pause / cancel / shutdown)
  is checked **between dispatches** — never inside a step, and never by
  parking, leasing or task-ifying the loop. The loop is the agent's own, the
  vehicle of the fact the Runtime asks the TaskManager to execute; an agent is
  **not** a task and **not** a recorded TM identity (its identity lives in the
  catalog, §4.8).

### 12.3 Sequence is forward-only; parallel has a gathering queue

The model distinguishes the two composites *conceptually* (implementation may
collapse one physical queue with message-type dispatch — that is an
implementation detail, not the model):

- **Sequence.** Pure forward pass: nothing returns to the sequence itself. The
  step advances **by position**: if `current_index < len(level_route)-1` the next
  step deposits into class `level_route[current_index+1]`; if it is the
  **end-of-level** (`current_index == len-1`) it deposits to
  `end_of_level_queue`. **No gathering queue.**
- **Parallel.** Two queues in the model: the class **inbox** and a
  **gathering queue** for the fan-in of the branched tasks (§12.4). The second
  queue belongs to the parallel class, not to an individual task, not to a
  parent. The parallel's `end_of_level_queue` **is** its gathering queue in the
  tokens it fans out (Schema 2): branches return there by position/level.

Both composites are themselves classes with their own queue/instances (§7,
dependencies); a composite is invoked like any capability agent — through its
inbox.

### 12.4 The flow: one advancement rule, fan-out and fan-in

**Single advancement mechanism (Schema 2).** Every agent (atomic and composite)
implements the same continuation logic, forward-only **by position + level**
over the token:

```
advance(request) for the current step (level_route[current_index]):
  next_index = current_index + 1
  if next_index < len(level_route):
      # advance within the level's sequence (no next_queue field; position rules)
      deposit an ExecutionRequestMessage to class level_route[next_index]
  else:
      # end-of-level
      if level == 1:
          # FLOW END: end-of-sequence AND level 1 → final result
          deposit the final result to end_of_level_queue (= final-result queue)
          # nothing more is routed
      else:
          # branch close: return to the creator's gathering via end_of_level_queue
          deposit an ExecutionResultMessage(output|error) to end_of_level_queue
```

This is the **generalized end rule** (addendum AV): an agent is the flow's end
when it is the last of its sequence AND `level == 1`, regardless of whether it
is a sequence step, an atomic, or a parallel — not by any `client:` store
mechanism. `end_of_level_queue` is assigned by the flow creator (the **submit**
sets it to the final-result queue; a **parallel** sets it to its own gathering
queue for its branches); the agent never decides the destination (Schema 2 /
addenda AJ/AL).

**Parallel fan-out.** On receiving its request, a parallel does **not** advance
while its branches run. It fans out giving each branch its own `level_route`,
`current_index = 0`, `end_of_level_queue` = the parallel's **gathering queue**,
and `level + 1`. Fan-in results land in the gathering queue and the parallel
**builds its payload** from the branch results (projecting each under its
`output_as`; collisions resolved via `output_as` namespacing — H3).
On **fan-in completion** the parallel decrements `level` (−1) and resumes its
own level (`current_index + 1` → next of its level), with `end_of_level_queue`
the one its creator supplied. Parallel-as-root (submit as the parallel's creator)
passes the parallel's sequence as level 1 with `end_of_level_queue` =
final-result queue (addendum AM).

**Where does "am I finished/fan-in complete" live?** In the per-class
**gathering bookkeeping** of the parallel (`state:parallel:<class>`, keyed by
task, under a lock, as in the reference), not in an out-of-message accumulator
and not in any central engine. A sequence needs no such bookkeeping at all
(§12.3).

**Failure and fan-in.** A child failure becomes an `ExecutionResultMessage`
with an `error` payload through the existing failure path (§7/ARCH §8, rule 9):
the parallel accounts for it (tolerant policy, R-6 refines) and the parent flow
continues or fails visibly. Exhausted attempts go to the DLQ (R-6). Errors are
never silent.

### 12.5 Handshake with the class lifecycle (deposit-time gate)

The one place execution and lifecycle meet is **deposit**: pushing work into
another class's queue. Rules (decoupled, local, no oracle):

1. **Nothing enters a non-enabled class** — neither a business submit (§6.1
   entry gate) nor an internal deposit by the advancement rule / fan-in.
   Enforcing at *consumption* is wrong: a disabled class keeps draining its
   pending work (policy A, §4.1/§4.6), so a message must never be allowed in.
2. **The gate is per-class data, not a central entity.** The class gate lives in
   one registry (`db.dict("gates")`, keyed by class = `{state: enabled|disabled}`)
   and is written **only** by the Runtime (in the lifecycle ops) and **read** by
   any depositor (a submit or an internal task). This is the same mirror
   principle as the catalog — local, named, no central authority deciding
   routing.
3. **Destroyed class = cleared queue + no gate.** beaver auto-creates a queue on
   `put` and offers no queue-deletion API, so a `put` to a destroyed class would
   silently rebuild an orphan queue and make the class look alive. `destroy`
   **clears the class queue and removes its gate row**; once the gate is gone,
   every deposit to that class is **blocked at the gate** (step 2) — no global
   oracle is needed to "know" the class died, and a `put` failure must never be
   relied on as an existence signal.
4. **Race at the threshold is accepted.** A deposit can win the race against a
   concurrent `disable`/`destroy`; the item then drains with the queue (policy
   A). This is best-effort by design, never a leak: the no-orphans invariant
   (§6) holds because every deposited message is either processed, visibly
   failed, or drained.
5. **A blocked deposit is a visible failure** through the failure mechanism
   (§12.4): if the gate is closed at deposit time, the step fails with an
   `error` result along its `end_of_level_queue` path (or failed task), never a
   silent no-op. **Exemptions**: an error-result deposit always proceeds
   regardless of the gate — a closed class keeps draining, and an error must
   always reach its return path.

### 12.6 Polling-only, fields not mechanisms (restated for execution)

- Retry is `next_run_at` (a field), never a sleep/delay in the flow.
- Idle is `get(block=False)` → `IndexError` → the instance loop returns.
- Scheduling/supervision of the instance loop is the TaskManager's (§6.1,
  §10 risks 3-5); the flow itself never sleeps, never loops waiting for a
  peer.
