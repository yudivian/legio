# legio — Architecture

## 0. Principles

- **Polling only.** Never callbacks or push, neither inside a node nor between
  nodes.
- **BeaverDB local per node** is the only shared memory between processes of the
  same node. No broker, no central database.
- **Atomic agents.** Each agent decides using only its message and the flow
  token; there is no central engine driving them.
- **Composition is a DAG over instances.** Two occurrences of the same pattern
  (`B, B`) are two independent tasks (two messages).
- **The flow moves through messages in queues**, never through
  process-resident state; each step builds a new `payload` that travels
  inside the messages themselves (§12 of `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md`).
- **Scale = replicas of the same agent** (pool); **federation = nodes sharing
  agents**.
- **Capability = a registered agent**; a tool is the internal resource backing
  it.
- **Domain knowledge lives 100% outside legio**: in patterns (YAML data) and in
  the tool registry injected by the consumer.

## 1. Layers

```
External API      Runtime (submit/status · lifecycle ops · CLI/HTTP)
Federation        catalog · resolver · work-item HTTP · outbox
Lifecycle         AgentRegistry (mirror: catalog + YAML cache) · TaskManager (task engine + scheduler)
Agents            linguistic · tool · sequence · parallel  (+ base)
Flow              FlowToken (level_route + current_index + end_of_level_queue + level) · message payload
Patterns          YAML → PatternSpec → pydantic models (compile-time)
Substrate         beaver native: dict(scope) · queue(name) · lock(name)
```

## 2. Substrate (beaver native, no invented wrapper)

`beaver` is the single substrate (see `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`). legio speaks it
**directly** — there is no `legio.primitives` abstraction layer: a
`db = await manager.db()` handle is passed around, and agents/managers address
beaver primitives by name, exactly as castor's Manager calls `db.dict` /
`db.queue` / `db.lock` directly.

- **Registry** — beaver persistent dict per scope: `db.dict("tasks")`
  (the TaskRegistry, Runtime-written, per `legio.manager.task_registry()`).
  Future scopes: `gates` (Runtime-written class gate, read by depositors —
  AGENT_LIFECYCLE §12.5), `semaphore`, `outbox`, the AgentRegistry's
  `catalog` / `instances` / `yaml_cache`, and the TaskManager's `tm_tasks` /
  `tm_control` (see `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md` §4.8/§6.1). There is **no**
  ``results`` return store: the final result is delivered to the
  **final-result queue** (Schema 2) — the Runtime owns a per-task final-result
  queue that the submit sets as the root `end_of_level_queue`.
- **Queue** — beaver persistent priority queue per agent:
  `db.queue("legio:queue:<agent_id>")`; `get(block=False)` pops destructively and
  raises `IndexError` when empty; `put(item, priority=...)` deposits the next
  request/result. An item is popped once and routed (rule 8: polling only — no
  schedule gate, no re-queue). The TaskManager adds its own two queues —
  `tm_pending` and `tm_scheduled` (§6.1).
- **Lock** — beaver lock with TTL + `renew`, used only where genuine mutual
  exclusion over a shared key is required (it is **not** a per-dispatch task
  lease: the dispatch is stateless and holds no lock).
- The **only** key namespace legio invents is the per-agent queue name
  (`legio:queue:<agent>`, `legio.naming.queue_key`); registries are beaver
  dicts addressed by scope name directly.
- **Messages** — `ExecutionRequestMessage` (starts/deposits a step) and
  `ExecutionResultMessage` (returns), always serialized as queue item payloads
  (`model_dump(mode="json")`).

## 3. FlowToken — the contract that moves everything

> The FlowToken carries per-level routing only: `level_route` (this level's
> route of classes) + `current_index` + `end_of_level_queue` + `level`.

Fields (Schema 2): `schema_version`, `level_route` (the route of **this level**:
a branch or sub-sequence — classes, not global patterns), `current_index`
(0-based position of the class processing in `level_route`), `end_of_level_queue`
(queue at the end of this level's sequence), `level` (branch-depth counter,
starts 1), `launcher_class` (class that started the flow; constant,
informational), `task_id` (public), `branch_id` (a parallel's branch slot
identity, assigned at fan-out to the branch class name and preserved through the
branch's execution; empty for non-branch messages), `message_type`
(execution_request | execution_result), `payload` (the data — single container
for both roles).

- **Who builds it**: the **submit** seeds the flow on a `main` agent in **level
  1** with `end_of_level_queue` = the **final-result queue** (there is no
  `client:{task_id}` queue and no `results` store — the final result is
  delivered to the final-result queue). The flow creator assigns destinations;
  the agent never decides where to deposit.
- **"Is it the flow end?" is derived from position + `level`**, not from a flag:
  end-of-sequence (`current_index == len(level_route)-1`) **and** `level == 1`
  ⇒ final (deliver to `end_of_level_queue` = final-result queue). End-of-level
  with `level > 1` ⇒ branch close (deliver to the creator's gathering queue via
  `end_of_level_queue`). Generalized end rule.
- **Parallel (branching)**: on receiving a request the parallel does not advance
  while its branches run; it fans out giving each branch its `level_route`,
  `current_index = 0`, `end_of_level_queue` = its **gathering queue**, `level + 1`
  and its `branch_id` (= the branch class name); on fan-in the returning result's
  `branch_id` names the join slot (so a multi-step branch, whose returned
  `level_route` expands to its own stages, still slots under the parent-assigned
  id). On fan-in completion it decrements `level` (−1) and resumes its
  level (`current_index + 1`), with `end_of_level_queue` the one its creator
  supplied. A parallel-as-branch at level 2 closes to its gathering; only a
  last-of-sequence at `level == 1` delivers the final result.
- It is a CPS-style continuation: *what am I (my class), where am I in my
  level's route, where does my level end, at what branch depth*.

## 4. Agent types

```
atomic:
  ├─ linguistic  → lingo (LLM → structured pydantic output)
  └─ tool        → tool registry (concrete deterministic op, local or remote)
composite:
  ├─ sequence    → one-by-one; advances current_index
  └─ parallel    → the only join point; inbox + gathering queue (§12 AGENT_LIFECYCLE)
```

- **Common base** (what truly abstracts all agents): `run()` = polling loop
  (pops one item once and routes it — no lease, no retry); `submit()`;
  `pool_size` replicas share the same queue; the
  input/output contract (`ExecutionRequest/ResultMessage` + `output_as`) is
  identical for every agent.
- Orchestration cannot tell a linguistic agent apart from a concrete one — only
  the internal resource differs.
- **Lifecycle (create / enable / disable / destroy)** is governed at two levels:
  the **class** (type + queue) by the catalog registry, and the **instance**
  (replica) by the **Runtime** (no "instance supervisor": the Runtime
  orchestrates materialization over the **TaskManager**, see
  `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md` §0/§6.1). Disabling a class closes entry but keeps
  draining pending work; no instances ⇒ class disabled; destroying the class is
  armageddon (removes spec + queue + all instances). Lifecycle governance touches
  only existence, never the DAG or routing. See
  `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md`.

## 5. The Tool

- **Definition**: an opaque, substitutable execution resource. It does not know
  about agents or queues, and it does **not** declare its input/output capacity —
  the consuming agents declare it via `output_as`/`output_schema` (Schema 3).
- **Declaration**: Schema 3 (`available_tools`) maps each tool name to
  `implementation` + `policy {timeout, retries}`. An atomic `kind: tool` pattern
  references the resource via `tool: <name>` and describes its call via the
  terse `parameters` (dotted path / literal); it declares its own
  `input_as`/`input_type`/`input_schema` and `output_as`/`output_type`/
  `output_schema`. Several patterns may share a tool; each is its own agent/
  queue, the resource is shared guarded by a per-tool concurrency semaphore.
- **Runtime (ToolAgent)**: resolves `tool: <name>` against the node's
  `available_tools` registry (loaded dynamically), resolves the terse
  `parameters` against the incoming payload, validates the call against the tool's
  signature **in execution** (the tool's contract is not verifiable at load),
  executes (async or blocking via `to_thread`), and bounds the output under the
  agent's `output_as`/`output_schema` — the consuming agents, not the tool,
  declare output capacity (Schema 3). It completes with an
  `ExecutionResultMessage`. On failure there is no output and the step is
  surfaced as a visible error result (never silent) — the tool never decides
  routing.
- **lingo is bounded to linguistic agents.** Concrete agents never pass through
  it. lingo's tool-calling is reserved for a future agentic path where the LLM
  chooses a tool — not the deterministic case.

## 6. Roles: Starting vs Capability (orthogonal to atomic/composite)

- The **catalog registers agents by name**; `starting` is a registration flag =
  a public entry point of the node. Any agent (atomic or composite) may be a
  starting agent.
- **Starting agent**: its parent is the client. It receives work from the API,
  which acts as a *synthetic parent* (only stages inputs and deposits the root
  step into the starting agent's queue — it never builds the DAG nor the root
  token; the **submit** seeds the flow in level 1 with `end_of_level_queue` =
  the **final-result queue**). The only contract difference: the flow is born on
  a `main` agent and its final result is delivered to the final-result queue —
  there is no `results:` store and no `client:{task_id}` queue (Schema 2).
- **Capability**: only invoked by another agent through a queue deposit; returns
  along its `end_of_level_queue` (the creator's gathering queue for a branch, or
  the final-result queue at flow end). A composite delegated to another node is
  likewise just a routable agent with the same fan-in contract.

## 7. Task lifecycle

1. Client calls the API → **Runtime**: creates `task_id`, registers state,
   stages inputs, deposits `ExecutionRequestMessage` into the starting agent's
   queue (the class entry gate is checked here — `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md`
   §5.6/§6.1).
2. The **submit** seeds the flow: `ExecutionRequestMessage` on the `main` class
   in **level 1**, `end_of_level_queue` = the **final-result queue**; the agent
   walks its flow.
3. Composite: sequence chains by position; parallel fans out (each branch gets
   its `level_route` + `current_index=0` + `level+1`, its own class queue; results
   gather in the parallel's gathering queue via `end_of_level_queue` —
   AGENT_LIFECYCLE §12.4).
4. Atomic: lingo if linguistic, tool registry if concrete.
5. Each branch returns through its `end_of_level_queue` (the parallel's gathering
   queue); the parallel fans in (dedupe per (parallel, task), bookkeeping
   `state:parallel:<class>`), builds the branch results into its payload and
   resumes its level.
6. **Flow end** = end-of-sequence AND `level == 1` → deliver the final result to
   `end_of_level_queue` = the **final-result queue** (no `results:` store, no
   `client:` queue). End-of-level with `level > 1` → branch close to the
   creator's gathering queue.
7. The client polls `status(task_id)` → Runtime reads the final result from the
   per-task final-result queue. Lifecycle of the agents themselves (not of a
   task) is governed by the Runtime / AgentRegistry / TaskManager model —
   `docs/AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md` §0–§6.1.

## 8. Failure and resilience

- **Errors are never silent** (AGENTS.md rule 9): a step that raises is routed
  to a visible `error` result; the task ends in a known terminal state. There is
  no retry policy and no re-queue — a raised step is surfaced, not re-run.
- **Polling only** (rule 8): nothing sleeps and nothing is leased; resilience is
  idempotency (an item deposited again produces the same outcome) and visibility,
  not at-least-once execution guards.
- **Tolerant parallel**: waits for all children; a child failure yields a final
  result with error / partial content according to the pattern's policy.

## 9. Federation between nodes (local-first, symmetric)

- Each node has **its own beaver** and **its own catalog**. The roster is
  **derived from its capacity**: a node registers an atomic because it
  implements its tool; a composite if it depends only on servable agents (local
  or reachable).
- **Nodes are symmetric peers — no roles.** There is no orchestrator/provider
  distinction. Any node may act as *author* (triggers work, owns results) and as
  *acceptor* (executes delegated work), depending on the task. Same codebase,
  different roster and starting agents via configuration only.
- **Starting agents are entry points** of their own node: only the node's own
  Runtime invokes them. They are not delegable; delegation applies to
  capability agents.
- Because agent resolution happens *before* deposit (in the author, against the
  catalog), an acceptor's agents never receive work for a pattern they do not
  serve.
- **Contract**: a step that needs an absent local agent may be delegated to a
  peer that registers it: a work-item (agent name + inputs) goes over HTTP → is
  deposited into the acceptor's queue → executed (atomic or a whole sub-DAG) →
  the result exits via **outbox**, consumed by the author via **polling**
  (write-before-ack; at-least-once documented).
- The **author owns the result**; the acceptor executes and returns. Work-item
  delivery is write-before-ack via the outbox, giving tolerance to an acceptor's
  outage.
- **Interfaces are versioned**: the catalog declares each agent's interface and
  `schema_version`; the author validates the interface on POST (4xx on
  mismatch). Only configured peers (`federation.peers`) are reachable (see
  Security).

## 10. Security — two coarse levels, two secrets

**Principle**: legio provides coarse access control at two separated levels, each
with its own token and blast radius; granular authorization (users, roles,
tenants, limits) is the application's layer on top of the node.

**Level 1 — nodes talking to nodes.** One **federation token**, the same value
in every node of the federation ("if you know the key, you're in"). Every
federation endpoint (`/catalog`, `/work-items/{agent}`, `/outbox/*`,
`/health`) requires `Authorization: Bearer <federation_token>`. Delegation only
between explicitly configured peers (`federation.peers` allowlist). Setup is
configuration, not a handshake.

**Level 2 — systems using a node.** Each system registered on a node gets its
own **client token** (`api.clients`), individually revocable: if one system has
problems, only its token is invalidated, the others keep working. The
The Runtime API (`submit`/`status`) requires a client token;

```yaml
api:
  clients:
    consumer-a: { token: <t1>, agents: [flow_a, flow_b] }  # restricted
    consumer-b: { token: <t2> }                           # all by default
```

- **Default granularity**: a client token without a restriction may access all
  starting agents; listing `agents` restricts it.
- **Task ownership**: every task is tagged with its `client_id`; `status` and
  results are only readable with the token of that `client_id`.

**A token of one level never grants the other; a single middleware enforces
the endpoint → token map.**

**Hook for the consumer**: the node is embedded in an application. The app may
wrap or replace the auth middleware (e.g. user login on top of the client
token) for granular control.

**Out of scope for legio** (operational/application layers): TLS termination
(reverse proxy), token rotation policy, rate limiting, mTLS, RBAC, audit
trails. TLS is required in production; tokens are secrets rotated by the
operator.

**Threat model accepted**: compromised client → revoke its token (blast radius =
one system); compromised node → rotate the federation token in all nodes.
Internal state (queues, registries, beaver) is local to the node and never served
over the network.

## 11. Patterns (YAML)

- `main` = starting agents (entry points); `type: atomic/composite` × `kind:
  tool/linguistic/sequence/parallel` = capabilities. Every agent declares the
  mandatory entry/output contract triples (`input_as/input_type/input_schema`
  and `output_as/output_type/output_schema`); `output_schema` → pydantic model
  at compile time; `output_as` = result namespacing; a tool's call is the terse
  `parameters` (dotted path / literal), and `tool: <name>` references a Schema 3
  `available_tools` key (Schema 1).
- Load is **fail-fast** with **cascade invalidation**: a pattern with an invalid
  dependency is deactivated along with everything that depends on it
  transitively. A dry-run validator ships with it.

## 12. Dependency map (see docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)

| Capability | Library |
|---|---|
| Queues/registries/locks | `beaver-db` |
| LLM / linguistic agents | `lingo-ai` |
| Types/validation/config | `pydantic` (+ `pydantic-settings`) |
| API + federation endpoints | `fastapi` + `uvicorn` |
| HTTP client (tools + nodes) | `httpx` |
| Patterns YAML | `pyyaml` |
| CLI | `typer` |
| Tests | `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `respx`, `MockLLM` |

## 13. Deliberate exclusions

Broker, Redis/central DB, workflow engine, scheduler library, callbacks, vector
store, castor (outdated against current beaver), session layer, in-memory
handles, and "pattern instances" with their own identity — two `B`s are two
tasks.
