"""`legio.flow.token` — the immutable FlowToken (LEG-011, Schema 2).

The FlowToken is the immutable payload travelling with a route. Finality is
*derived from position* (``is_final(total_steps)`` compares ``current_index``
against the last step), never stored. A root token marks the task as a client
process (``root``); the actual return destination is the submit's
``end_of_level_queue`` (the final-result queue) and lives in the token, never
derived from ``task_id`` — there is no ``client:{task_id}`` family (addenda
AJ/AL).
