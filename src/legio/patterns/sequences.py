"""`legio.patterns.sequences` — starting-route derivation (R-4, LEG-044).

Derives the starting route the submit delivers to. The submit is a dumb
delivery point: it only hands the task to the **starting agent** (the chosen
``main``) and never resolves any DAG. That agent — atomic or composite —
concretizes its own sub-DAG at runtime (ARCHITECTURE §3/§6):

- An atomic (tool/linguistic) starts on its own class.
- A composite starts on its own class; the composite runner concretizes the
  fan-out to its branches (AGENT_LIFECYCLE §12.4).
